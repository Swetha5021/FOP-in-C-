/*Stick games I
After winning gold and silver in Indian Computing Olympiad 2016, Tyrion Lannister and Jaime Lannister want to have some fun. Now they are playing a game
on a grid made of n horizontal and m vertical sticks. Let us assume a grid where, n = 3 and m = 3. There are n + m = 6 sticks in total. There are n*m = 9 
intersection points, numbered from 1 to 9. The rules of the game are very simple. The players move in turns. Tyrion won gold, so he makes the first move.
During his/her move, a player must choose any remaining intersection point and remove from the grid all sticks which pass through this point. A player will
lose the game if he cannot make a move (i.e. there are no intersection points remaining on the grid at his move). Assume that both players play optimally. 
Who will win the game?
